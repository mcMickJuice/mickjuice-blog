[Understanding the 8 Fallacies of Distributed Systems](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-the-8-fallacies-of-distributed-syste)

## Overview

The author presents the 8 Fallacies of Distributed Systems in the following format:

- describing the fallacy
- why an engineer must be cognizant of said fallacy
- solution to accommodating said fallacy

This makes for a concise and useful article for those engineers that work on distributed systems and a service oriented architecture. There are a ton of good links to principles both relating to distributed system architecture as well as general system design patterns.

## Key Takeaways

- accommodating for lack fo network reliability is a hard problem, with retries and queuing presenting problems of their own.
- you should treat systems that are outside of your control differently than components that you own.
- each point presented reinforces that assertion that designing distributed systems is hard.
